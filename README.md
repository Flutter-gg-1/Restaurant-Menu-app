# Restaurant Menu App

## Overview

The Restaurant Menu App is a mobile application built using Flutter that allows users to browse a restaurant's menu, view details about specific dishes, and interact with special offers or coupons. The app features a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate through different sections of the menu.

## Features

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - **Scan Coupon**: Users can scan a coupon, which opens a `BottomSheet` displaying the coupon details and a QR code.
  - **Show Info**: Users can view additional information via an alert dialog, which can be closed by pressing a button.
