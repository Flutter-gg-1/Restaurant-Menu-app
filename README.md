# Important

I spent few hours trying to figure out how to change the indicator background color when clicking an item without losing it's elevation effect. and i couldn't get it. I could do it with onTap function inside the TabBar hence changing background color of the clicked item . but i spared myself the hussle because i'm pretty sure tabBar has a function for that specifically.
I hope you understand :)
